		<p>As you may know, cookies are what websites like to eat in order to gain money. Each website on the internet has a cookie policy. I am here to tell you what that policy is in the most confusing and long-winded way possible in order to make sure I can get away as much as possible. I want your cookies and to eat them too. I want to tell these cookies to data brokers and advertisers to make a lot of money. It's like enough money to sell out to whoever. Like I don't care who I sell this to, it is an all-you-can-eat buffet out there. So how will I explain this to you in a comprehensive way? Well, that is the beauty of this page. Below I will dedicate my cookie policy and what cookies are to give you a full and lunch understanding of what I will be doing. I will not be leaving this ambiguous; this will be as clear as rain. I will not try to lead you astray in this quest for transparency. I will not be just as clear as a milky quartz. No, I will be as clear as glass for you.</p>

		<p>So what are cookies? Not only are they a delicious snack in the real world they are also a pivotal ingredient in the soup that is the online world. These are little data caches that you store on your computer so I can remember your preferences, and what you looked up, and they also add certain functionality. Now will add this functionality to help you out? No. My cookies are made for what I want them to do, who cares about user experience? Cause like the only things that matter are cookies. Like I want to be the cookie monster and google up all those delicious succulent cookies. I just want those cookies that just steal data ya know. I want to make this website visiting experience ruin your ads forever. I want you to rue the day you can and visit this website. I want you to question everything you have ever done and will ever do. This website should break your soul, break your spirit. Make you fall into the decent and madness you deserve. Welcome to your retribution. You know what you have done.</p>

		<p>Cookies are incredible. Yes, I am talking about the real ones. This is my real-world cookie policy. I’d have to say the most scrumptiously scrumptious cookies that exist are chocolate chip cookies. The perfect chocolate chip cookie comes out of the oven just before it is done, leaving the center all warm and gooey so when you take your first bite the chocolate just melts in your mouth. It is a real kind of heavenly goodness. I would like to think that of the ingredients in a chocolate chip cookie, three are the most essential: chunky chocolate chips, cinnamon, and vanilla extract. Normal chocolate chips are, of course, perfectly acceptable. But acceptable is not perfection. A chunky chocolate chip means that the chocolate chip has extra pizzazz, ya know? For vanilla, there is never too much vanilla. But my recipe calls for a teaspoon, you say? Put at least three in. Measure with your heart, because a chocolate chip cookie fills the heart which means that you need the proper amount of vanilla. Finally, there is cinnamon. Why should I add cinnamon, you ask? Because I said so. Just add the cinnamon and trust me–you really won’t regret it.</p>

		<p>Now I have a confession to make: I don't use cookies. I have not made or implemented any cookies. I lied to you in order to I don't know…improve my self-esteem. Like I don't even know what I’m supposed to be doing here. I was trying to confuse you so I could pretend to be selling your data. Like the message kinda goes lost in what I could call my hostility. I am not sorry anymore.
